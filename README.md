# Training_center_management
This is a website for training facility management. Anyone may enroll as a student and take numerous courses. The administrator may add teachers and trainers, courses, and events, as well as view, change, and remove information. A teacher can have restricted access to courses and student information, but he requires an administrator for final publishing. A student can change his details, and he must complete the payment procedure after enrolling in the courses for final approval.

This is the home page
